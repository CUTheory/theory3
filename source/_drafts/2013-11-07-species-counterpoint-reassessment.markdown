Most of you can articulate the basic concepts of voice-leading verbally. However, many of you are struggling to demonstrate mastery in the *application* of those principles musically. As a result, a number of groups have not performed to the standard that I would have liked on the Unit I species counterpoint portfolios. A number of you are also still having difficulty with the self-assessment process. And while that is an important skill to learn, it is starting to detract from some of the music that needs to be at the center of our work. With that in mind, I have a few very important announcements about your Unit I and II coursework and grades.

## Assessment reports ##

I am making some changes to the assessment scheme for the class. You will receive an update to your assessment report in Google Drive that reflects this new arrangement. Below that, under "Old Report," you can still see all of your reflection and our discussion about it from earlier in the semester. 

Here's what the new scheme will look like. We will have just six categories:

- Strict voice-leading (two part)  
- Strict keyboard-style voice-leading  
- Harmony  
- Text-music relationships  
- Professionalism  
- Liberal-arts values

We will retain self-assessment for the *professionalism* and *liberal arts values* categories. You will continue to reflect on your progress and assign yourself a letter grade for those categories as we go, and I will respond to your comments and "negotiate" the grade (if necessary).

I have dropped three categories relating to German art song in order to focus our efforts more intently, leaving only *harmony* and *text-music relationships*.

For the categories besides *professionalism* and *liberal arts values*, grades will be assigned to you by me (based in part on feedback from our TA). In each case, when a final grade is assigned, you will have the opportunity to respond and "negotiate" if you deem it appropriate. I will take your responses to heart, and I am willing to adjust the grade if you make a strong case. However, you will not be producing grades from scratch for these categories.

Final grades for the semester will still be calculated in the same way.


## Unit I voice-leading portfolios ##

The Unit I portfolios were not up to the standard that I would like, and that I think you need in order to be prepared for further musical activities. Thus, I would like to give you one last opportunity to shore up these skills. (Which translates into one more opportunity to raise your grade.) For those of you who did well, I have assigned a grade of A or B already in your new report (forthcoming). If you are content with your level of mastery and that grade, you don't have to do anything more for species counterpoint. If there is no grade provided, or if you want another chance to improve your skills and grade, see the re-assessment opportunity below.

## Unit II voice-leading primers ##

Because some of you were able to articulate species concepts verbally at a much higher level than you could apply them musically in Unit I, I am suspicious that the same may be true for Unit II. This, I would like to see an attempt at applying the concepts explored in Unit II before assigning those grades. Thus *everyone* should see below for the final keyboard-style voice-leading assignment.

## *Final voice-leading assignments* ##

This assignment will be performed *individually* and due _____. You can use any resources *other than other people* to complete this assignment. In other words, you can use a instrument (you are *encouraged* to use an instrument), class resources, other textbooks, etc., but you cannot consult another person besides the instructor or TA in composing these exercises. Because it will be done individually and outside of class, it will only be accepted if you re-affirm the CU honor code on the assignment as follows:

> **I herby reaffirm the CU honor code.**  
[sign or type name]

or simply:

> **IHRTCUHC**  
[sign or type name]

The assignment will have two parts: species counterpoint and keyboard-style voice-leading. You only need do the species counterpoint part if you are unhappy with the grade on your new assessment report.

**Species counterpoint**

- Choose four [cantus firmi](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/Graphics/counterpoint/cantusFirmi.pdf): two in major, two in minor.  
- Compose a flawless third-species counterpoint above one of the major cantus.  
- Compose a flawless third-species counterpoint below one of the minor cantus.  
- Compose a flawless fourth-species counterpoint above one of the minor cantus.  
- Compose a flawless fourth-species counterpoint below one of the major cantus.  
- Typeset all in music notation software, saving each exercise as its own PDF file.  
- Create a folder in Google Drive lableled "LASTNAME Voice-leading Portfolio".  
- Upload all PDFs to folder and share folder with instructor.

**Keyboard-style voice-leading**

- Choose two [figured-bass lines]({{ root_url }}/media/chromaticBassLines.pdf): one in major, one in minor.  
- Watch my videos on [strict keyboard style](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/strictKeyboardStyle.html) and [melodic-style figured-bass realization](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/melodicKB.html).  
- Compose a flawless basso-continuo realization (no melody, just chords) above the minor-mode bass line.  
- Compose a flawless melodic-style realization above the major-mode bass line.  
- Typeset all in music notation software, saving each exercise as its own PDF file.  
- Upload all PDFs to voice-leading folder in Google Drive (see above) to share with instructor.

N.B.: You have all received feedback from our TA and/or myself on the species exercises and composed revisions based on that feedback. If you have still not demonstrated mastery over those species (and are, therefore, doing this assignment), you are *strongly encouraged* to seek in-person help from instructor or TA before submitting this. Schedule those meetings as early as you can to ensure that they can take place. Likewise, you have not written a keyboard-style exercise before (including the chromatic chords covered this semester, anyway), so you are highly encouraged to do this assignment early and meet with instructor or TA to discuss it with plenty of time to revise, if necessary.

Good luck! Remember that we are here to help you with this project.
