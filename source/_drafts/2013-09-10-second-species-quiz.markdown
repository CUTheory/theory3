*Following are some general responses to the second-species quiz. Please review before Wednesday's meeting.*

**5. Large leaps are more common in second-species counterpoint than in first species. Why do you think that is? In other words, are there factors that necessitate more large leaps in second species? and/or Are there attenuating factors in second-species that make large leaps less problematic?**

There are two main reasons for this. First, more large leaps are *needed* to add variety to the texture. All steps and a few small leaps would lead to monotony, given how many more notes there are in a second-species counterpoint line. 

Second, we have more freedom in second species to use leaps because some of the constraints of first species are gone. For instance, in first species, all leaps would take place when both voices move, making them stand out more, which reduces smoothness. In second species, leaps *within a bar* don't detract from smoothness as much, and so they fit in to the texture better than first species, leading to them being more common.
