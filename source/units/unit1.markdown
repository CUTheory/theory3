## Goals ##

The primary goal for this unit is to review and solidify the principles of good voice-leading in a strict style (two-voice species counterpoint), which will serve as the basis for further compositional work later in the semester. Though the specific rules of strict voice-leading are important, *the underlying principles of good voice-leading are the most important aspect of this unit*.

The secondary goal for this unit is to introduce you to some of the tools and methods we will employ in this course so that you will be comfortable with them before we address wholly new material. Chief among these are active work in class, collaboration, self-evaluation, criterion-referenced assessment, and several technological tools.

## Classwork and unit project ##

This unit will address strict counterpoint in two voices, covering the first four species. For each species, we will follow the same pattern:

- Monday (in class): analytical inquiry  
- Tuesday (due online): read/watch assigned resource and take a short, online quiz  
- Wednesday (in class): resource discussion, compositional practice  
- Thursday (due online): submit self-evaluation  
- Ongoing (out of class): assemble final portfolio
