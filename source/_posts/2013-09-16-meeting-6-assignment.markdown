Work with your group on your shared portfolio of species exercises. I will be happy to comment on the work in your portfolio as you go, but only after everyone in your group has given their own input for the exercise or question that is causing difficulty. (I will give some official feedback before Wednesday on your first- species portfolio in GDrive, and time permitting your second-species progress.)

*For Meeting 7 (Sept. 18):*

Be sure to bring a device to class that will allow you to work in Piazza.

Continue the discussion on music, philosophy, and the liberal arts—as far as it interests you—in Piazza. We'll return to the topic from time to time as appropriate to the tasks we are performing in class.
