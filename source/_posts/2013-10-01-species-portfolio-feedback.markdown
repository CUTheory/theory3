I have provided feedback to all fourth-species submissions in your Google Drive folders where you submitted them. Please review those notes and update your portfolio as necessary before Monday. Also, if you did not receive feedback for first species because of a file format issue, I have not provided you feedback on those, as well.

Kellan should be getting you feedback on third species by Wednesday or Thursday.

If you did not submit third- or fourth-species exercises yesterday, you will not receive any feedback on those species, even during office hours, before the final portfolio is due on Oct. 7.
