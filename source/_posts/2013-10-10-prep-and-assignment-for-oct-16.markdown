Before Wednesday's class, revise your group's primer in Google docs with the basic principles of *basso continuo* voice-leading discussed in Monday's class. You may incorporate principles and ideas discussed in class or shared by your classmates, but you must express those ideas in your own words in your group's primer.

Be sure to bring a device to class on Wednesday for working in Google Drive.
