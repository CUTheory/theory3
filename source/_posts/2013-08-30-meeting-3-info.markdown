I have looked through the Learning Catalytics quizzes. Please log in to see specific comments from me on some of your answers, and see the [previous post]({{ root_url }}/2013/08/notes-on-first-species-quiz/) for some general comments on the quiz that will help guide your composition and analysis throughout this unit.

On Wednesday, we will begin class getting your self-evaluation forms set up. If you are at all reticent or confused when it comes to these technological things, please bring your laptop/tablet to make sure you have it set up correctly before you leave class.

The rest of the class time will be devoted to composing. Be sure to bring manuscript paper and a pencil, or a laptop/tablet with notation software installed and ready to go, to class on Wednesday.
