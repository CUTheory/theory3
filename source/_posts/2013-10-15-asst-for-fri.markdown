Before 8am on Friday, work with your group (in person, or online) to clean up your primer in Google Drive. Your primer thus far should include:

- a concise set of principles for chord voicing in basso continuo style  
- a consise set of principles for motion (of notes from one chord to the next) in basso continuo style  
- a concise explanation of the differences between chord voicing in basso continuo style and melodic style  
- a concise explanation of the differences between principles of motion in basso continuo style and melodic style

I will announce on Friday, after reviewing these, what you should bring to class on Monday (probably staff paper and/or a device for Google Drive or Learning Catalytics). There will be no additional assignment, but I may post some resources that would be helpful for review over the weekend.
