Before our next meeting (Wednesday, Aug. 28), sign up for [Learning Catalytics](http://www.learningcatalytics.com) and [Piazza](http://www.piazza.com) (if you didn't already). Also, read the following resources: [introduction to strict voice-leading](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/speciesIntro.html) and [composing a *cantus firmus*](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/cantusFirmus.html). 

Please make use of Piazza, rather than emailing me directly, if you have any questions about the reading, the course, the syllabus, the policies, the homework, or the technology.
