We will begin Unit II as planned on Monday, Sept. 30. However, you will have a little more time to work on your species portfolios. Please pay careful attention to the following schedule and keep on-task with your group. No late submissions will be accepted except in the case of an emergency, and technology problems do not constitute an emergency. You should be more than familiar enough with these tools now.

- Monday, Sept. 30, 9am: Submit your best two third-species exercises and your best two fourth-species exercises for feedback. Nothing submitted after that time will be given feedback before the final portfolio submission.  
- Monday, Oct. 7, 9am: Submit your final species portfolio (16 exercises per the Unit II guide).

All submissions should be PDF files in your group's Google Drive submission folder. Make sure all group members' last names are in the folder title and on every document you submit.

If you have any issues or questions, contact me well in advance of the deadlines. Keep in mind that I rarely respond to student emails on weekends, especially Sundays.
