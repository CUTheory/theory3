Before 8am on Tuesday, Sept. 24, please do the following:

- Review the discussion on fourth-species counterpoint from Monday's class on Piazza.  
- Read the resource on [Composing a fourth-species counterpoint](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/fourthSpecies.html), and watch the videos at the end.  
- Log on to [Learning Catalytics](http://learningcatalytics.com), use session ID 747127, and take the short quiz.  

Before Wednesday's class, please review any feedback I provide you individually via Learning Catalytics or collectively on the course website after the quizzes have been completed.

*Notes on the quiz:*  
All quizzes in this course are *open-note*. You are also *encouraged* to talk to each other, in person or on Piazza, as you work on this quiz. However, be sure that the short-answer responses are 1) short (!), and 2) in your own words.

Please bring all of your notes, examples, and other materials to class on Wednesday, as well as a device that is compatible with Learning Catalytics. (Smart phones, tablets, laptops, or web-friendly e-readers are all fine.)
