Form a group of 2â€“4 students that will work together on the Unit II portfolio. Using the template provided during class (available in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cXzNiQlpRM0o5UXc&usp=sharing)), create a document where you will build your primer on keyboard-style voice leading.

Using the [model basso-continuo style voice-leading examples]({{ root_url }}/media/modelBassoContinuo-withFuncBass.pdf) distributed in class, work with that group to discern the principles according to which those examples are realized from the figured bass line. Focus on two main issues: *chord voicing* (what notes go into the chord and which are doubled/left out) and *motion* (how do individual pitches in one chord progress to the pitches in the next chord). 

For Monday, try to come up with *five* or less principles that cover all situations relating to *chord voicing*, and *three* or less principles that cover all sitations relating to *motion*. Each principle should be expressed in clear, grammatically correct sentences in your Google document, not bullet points.

Do as much as you can within your group, but feel free to consult other groups on Piazza if you get stuck.
