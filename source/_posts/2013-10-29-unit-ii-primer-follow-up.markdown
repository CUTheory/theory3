Now that your groups have completed your voice-leading primers, it is time for you to read *my* primer. It was previously hidden from the [Resources](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship) site, but is now back up. Before Wednesday's class (Nov. 6), read/watch the following:

1. [Strict keyboard-style voice-leading – Basso continuo](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/strictKeyboardStyle.html)  
2. [Realizing a figured bass line in melodic keyboard style](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/melodicKB.html)  
3. [Keyboard-style voice-leading schemata](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/KBVLschemata.html)

Before Monday's class (Nov. 11), every *individual* student should compare his/her group's primer to resources 1 & 2 above, and for every difference between your primer and mine, write either 1) an explanation of why your primer is right and mine is wrong, or 2) an explanation of the concept I explained that you omitted or explained incorrectly. For each difference, your explanation should be as concise as possible (just a couple sentences; no more than a paragraph).

Write these explanations together in a Google Document and share it with me by 8am on Monday, Nov. 11.

Since this assignment involves self-assessment (what did we get right, wrong, miss altogether?), this will take the place of self-assessment for this unit's material. If between your group's primer and this assignment you clearly and concisely explain all the major concepts in keyboard-style voice-leading, you will receive an A for *strict keyboard-style voice-leading*. Thus, there is no reason the entire class shouldn't receive an A for that category.

As always, make use of my office hours this week (Monday: 2–3pm; Wednesday: 1–3pm) and Piazza if there is anything you don't understand in the resources I provided you.
