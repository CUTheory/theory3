Before 8am on Thursday, August 29, please do the following:

- Review the discussion on first-species counterpoint from Wednesday's class on Piazza.  
- Read the resource on [Composing a first-species counterpoint](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/firstSpecies.html), and watch the video at the end.  
- Log on to [Learning Catalytics](http://learningcatalytics.com), use session ID 632054, and take the short quiz.  

*Notes on the quiz:*  
All quizzes in this course are *open-note*. You are also *encouraged* to talk to each other, in person or on Piazza, as you work on this quiz. However, be sure that the short-answer responses are 1) short (!), and 2) in your own words.

Since we have a day off on Monday, be sure to review the reading and your quiz responses (and any feedback I send you) before class next Wednesday.

Be sure to bring manuscript paper and a pencil, or a laptop/tablet with music notation software. (I highly recommend [MuseScore](http://www.musescore.org), [NoteFlight](http://www.noteflight.com), and [Lilypond](http://www.lilypond.org)â€”all free, all with different strengths.)

If you have any questions, please ask them on Piazza.
