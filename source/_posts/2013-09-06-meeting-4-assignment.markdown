Before 8am on Tuesday, Sept. 10, please do the following:

- Review the discussion on second-species counterpoint from Monday's class on Piazza.  
- Read the resource on [Composing a second-species counterpoint](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/secondSpecies.html), and watch the video at the end.  
- Log on to [Learning Catalytics](http://learningcatalytics.com), use session ID 76824, and take the short quiz.  

Before Wednesday's class, please review any feedback I provide you individually via Learning Catalytics or collectively on the course website after the quizzes have been completed.

*Notes on the quiz:*  
All quizzes in this course are *open-note*. You are also *encouraged* to talk to each other, in person or on Piazza, as you work on this quiz. However, be sure that the short-answer responses are 1) short (!), and 2) in your own words.

Be sure to bring manuscript paper and a pencil, or a laptop/tablet with music notation software, to class on Wednesday. (I highly recommend [MuseScore](http://www.musescore.org), [NoteFlight](http://www.noteflight.com), and [Lilypond](http://www.lilypond.org)â€”all free, all with different strengths.)
