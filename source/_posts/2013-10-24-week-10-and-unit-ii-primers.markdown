*By Monday, Nov. 4, 9am*:

Finish your final keyboard-style voice-leading primers with your group. The primers should be written in clean, grammatical prose, and they should include information on *voicing* and *motion* for all diatonic chords and all common chromatic chords (Neapolitan, augmented-sixth chords, and applied chords) in *basso continuo* and *melodic* keyboard style. You have resources in Google Drive that we collaborated on in class for some of these principles. Use them to guide your work, but be sure to put everything in your own words.

Class time on Wednesday will be reserved for work on this, so be sure to make good use of that time. Kellan will be present to answer some questions as you work. I will be at a conference on Wednesday, but will be available on Piazza. Please direct all questions for me there. I will not be checking my CU email frequently while at my conference.

This is your end-of-unit project submission, so make sure it is solid. Catch up where you need to, and make sure it is written in excellent prose. And by all means, include musical examples in your text where helpful. I have made [a resource](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/createGraphic.html) that can help you do that.
