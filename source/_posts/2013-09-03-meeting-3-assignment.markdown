*By 8am on Thursday, Sept. 4:*

Update your self-evaluation concerning the two conceptual areas we have engaged thus farâ€”*strict voice-leading* and *professionalism*. Include any relevant information on what you've done in class so far to demonstrate mastery (or progress toward mastery) in those areas.

*Ongoing:*

Work with your group on your shared portfolio of species exercises. It is a good idea to try to finish each species as we go (one species, four exercises, per week) in order to stay on schedule for submitting a solid, complete portfolio at the end of the unit. Consider using Google Drive as a place to store your finshed exercises, as well as your in-progress work, so every group member has access to the entire portfolio at all times. I will be happy to comment on the work in your portfolio as you go, but only after everyone in your group has given their own input for the exercise or question that is causing difficulty.

*For Meeting 4 (Sept. 9):*

Be sure to bring a device to class that will allow you to work in Piazza. We will repeat last week's analysis exercise but for second species counterpoint this time.
