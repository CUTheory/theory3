For *Monday, Oct. 7*, do the following:

- Submit your complete Unit I species counterpoint portfolio in your group's submissions folder on Google Drive. Make sure the final portfolio is clearly labeled, either as a single PDF file, or a folder containing the various PDF files.  
- Submit an updated self-evaluation that includes a grade for two-voice counterpoint and a grade for professionalism, along with *detailed* comments (1â€“2 paragraphs) that reference specific reasons for the grades you chose. These should include things like counterpoints in your group portfolio that you composed or offered significant corrections to, insights expressed on quizzes, Piazza, or in class, etc.  
- Read the Unit II guide (link to the right) and come to class on Monday with any questions about it.
