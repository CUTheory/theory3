Before class on Oct. 9, please do the following:

- Read the new resource on [Harmonic analysis](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/harmonicAnalysis.html), and write down any questions you have about it and bring them to class.  
- Review any functional-bass materials that have caused you confusion (readngs and Learning Catalytics quizzes or class activities).  
- Bring a device that will allow you to work in Google Drive (a laptop, or a tablet *with the Google Drive app installed*). We will work there instead of Piazza on Wednesday for our analysis activity.
