This week, your main task is to work on your final project. However, before Wednesday's class, please also do the following:

- Update the *professionalism* and *liberal arts values* section on your self-assessment. This will be your final professionalism update. Most of you have done this recently, so there won't be much to change or add.  
- Take [a very short, anonymous survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/NGKGKTL) on this course.  
- [Sign up for an oral exam time](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY), if you haven't already.

Also, please bring your "Mondnacht" materials to class on Wednesday.
