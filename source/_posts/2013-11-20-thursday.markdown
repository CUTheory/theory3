I will be working from home on Thursday and Friday, but I will be available to help those of you who would like feedback on your species re-assessments. If that is you, please email me (I will keep my CU email open throughout the day) either to solicit feedback, or to schedule a time for a quick video chat. I have a couple "meetings" already scheduled, and I will accomodate as many of you all as I can in my remaining time. Please take advantage of this if you have any questions about your species reassessment.

Have a great break!
