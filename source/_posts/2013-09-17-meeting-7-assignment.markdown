*By 8am on Thursday, Sept. 19:*

- Review the discussion on third-species counterpoint from Monday's class on Piazza.  
- Read the resource on [Composing a third-species counterpoint](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/thirdSpecies.html), and watch the video at the end.  
- Bring your model third-species examples back to class on Wednesday, labeling two examples of each of the following techniques described in the reading: 
- - dissonant passing tone  
- - dissonant neighbor tone  
- - double neighbor  
- - nota cambiata    
- For each work group: Upload your two best second-species exercises thus far to your group's Google Drive folder for me to take a look at and give you feedback (in addition to the first-species exercises already in those folders).

There is no online quiz for third species.

*For Meeting 8 (Sept. 23):*

Be sure to bring a device to class that will allow you to work in Piazza. We will move on to fourth-species analysis on Wednesday.
