# Concepts and skills #

The goals for this course are for students to assimilate the following concepts and apply them in the composition and/or analysis of classical music in particular styles. The concepts we will address are:

- Harmony  
- Voice-leading  
- Form  
- Musical style  
- Relationships between harmony, voice-leading, form, and style    
- Relationships between music and text  
- Professionalism  
- Liberal education values

For these topics, Semester 3 Theory is the end of the study of tonal Western art music in the core theory sequence. Thus, we will engage them at a deep level, with a view towards applying the skills and concepts addressed in musical genres not studied directly.

# Topics of study #

The first three concepts—*harmony*, *voice-leading*, and *form*—have already been covered substantially in the first two semesters of music theory. The key to this course is what follows in the concept list. Basic musical features like harmony, voice-leading, and form are not uniform across all of Western music. Each musical style (and sub-style) has its own set of normative practices. These norms encompass differences in the way harmony, voice-leading, and form play out in each genre, as well as the ways in which they relate to each other. Thus a full understanding of compositional practice in Western music includes an understanding of musical style, and the diversity of "normative" practices within the broad category of Western art music.

With that in mind, this course will focus intentionally on the normative harmonic, contrapuntal, and formal structures of multiple styles, with a view towards understanding both the *general* traits that underly most or all of Western tonal music, and the *specific* traits that are typical of one or more specific styles of Western tonal music. (N.B.: This is the goal you should have in mind when constructing your self-evaluations, and against which I will consider your evaluations in determining final grades.)

In order to accomplish this, the course will be divided into three units, following two *strict* styles and one *historical* compositional style:

- Strict two-voice composition (species counterpoint)  
- Strict keyboard-style composition  
- The German art song (Lied)

We will engage all conceptual areas in each of the three units (with the exception of *relationships between music and text*, which will be specific to the study of Lieder).

For more detail on expectations for students in regards to these conceptual areas, see the course assessment guide.

# Course materials #

### Required ###

- A semester account for [Learning Catalytics](http://www.learningcatalytics.com).  
- A web-enabled device that can be brought to each class meeting (laptop, tablet, smartphone, web-friendly eReader, iPod Touch, etc.).  
- A free account to [Twitter](http://twitter.com).  
- A free account to [GitHub](http://github.com).  
- An account for [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) (a free account should be sufficient for this course).  
- A free Google account (for maintaining self-evaluations on Google Drive)—if you already have a Gmail address, you already have this. (Adventurous students may alternatively use a free, private student account on GitHub for their self-evaluations.)  

All other required class materials will be posted or linked to on the course website.

### Recommended, but not required ###

- Clendinning/Marvin, *The Musician's Guide to Theory and Analysis*.

(If you own this from last year, hang on to it. It will be a helpful supplemental resource, and we will likely use it more next semester. If you do not own it, library copies and/or borrowing from a classmate on occasion should suffice.)
